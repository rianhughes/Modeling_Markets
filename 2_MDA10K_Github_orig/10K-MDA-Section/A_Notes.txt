MDA_Tone.csv contains the list of successfuly scraped and processed files (by the academics).

Contains ID, POS, NEG, Tone, and the Link (and other info)

I have created a script (1_dwnld.py) which loads in MDA_Tone.csv (without the first line) and creates aanother files which stores the links from MDA_Tone.csv
I used the script to downloaded these files. 

Unfortunately there are directories on the SEC website which had the text files of interet to the academics, but no xlsx files.
Actually, there were xlsx files, but not all of them found data for 'Total Assets' so i need to match the ones that did.
So I had to create a script to match them.

Script 1 downloads the xlsx and xls files from the set of links used to download the 10k documents used by the academics

Script 2 extracts the desired information from these xlsx files (Total Assests by default - since it's easy and clean), and stores in 0_XLSX_REAGG_DATA.csv.

Script 3 combines the xlsx and tone data that overlap

Script 4 does some basic pandas stuff

To look for change in momentum of the data by year
