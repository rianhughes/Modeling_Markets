Count the number of times an asset is mentioned on social media, news websites, etc and find the correlation between it and the change in the assets price.

Example assets: BTC, other cryptos, gold, metals.

I suspect that 'hype' assets like tulips and btc will show a stronger correlation. May need to incorporate senitment analysis.
